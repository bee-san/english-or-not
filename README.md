## ‚ö° Quick Install

```bash
# As a CLI tool
cargo install gibberish-or-not

# As a library in Cargo.toml
gibberish-or-not = "4.0.3"
```

## üéØ Examples

```rust
use gibberish_or_not::{is_gibberish, is_password, Sensitivity};

// Password Detection
assert!(is_password("123456"));  // Detects common passwords

// Valid English
assert!(!is_gibberish("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", Sensitivity::Medium));
assert!(!is_gibberish("Hello, world!", Sensitivity::Medium));

// Gibberish
assert!(is_gibberish("asdf jkl qwerty", Sensitivity::Medium));
assert!(is_gibberish("xkcd vwpq mntb", Sensitivity::Medium));
assert!(is_gibberish("println!({});", Sensitivity::Medium)); // Code snippets are classified as gibberish
```

## üî¨ How It Works

Our advanced detection algorithm uses multiple components:

### 1. üìö Dictionary Analysis
- **370,000+ English words** compiled into the binary
- Perfect hash table for O(1) lookups
- Zero runtime loading overhead
- Includes technical terms and proper nouns

### 2. üßÆ N-gram Analysis
- **Trigrams** (3-letter sequences)
- **Quadgrams** (4-letter sequences)
- Trained on massive English text corpus
- Weighted scoring system

### 3. üéØ Smart Classification
- Composite scoring system combining:
  - English word ratio (40% weight)
  - Character transition probability (25% weight)
  - Trigram analysis (15% weight)
  - Quadgram analysis (10% weight)
  - Vowel-consonant ratio (10% weight)
- Length-based threshold adjustment
- Special case handling for:
  - Very short text (<10 chars)
  - Non-printable characters
  - Code snippets
  - URLs and technical content

## üéöÔ∏è Sensitivity Levels

The library provides three sensitivity levels:

### High Sensitivity
- Most lenient classification
- Easily accepts text as English
- Best for minimizing false positives
- Use when: You want to catch anything remotely English-like

### Medium Sensitivity (Default)
- Balanced approach
- Suitable for general text classification
- Reliable for most use cases
- Use when: You want general-purpose gibberish detection

### Low Sensitivity
- Most strict classification
- Requires strong evidence of English
- Best for security applications
- Use when: False positives are costly

## üîë Password Detection

Built-in detection of common passwords:

```rust
use gibberish_or_not::is_password;

assert!(is_password("123456"));     // Common password
assert!(is_password("password"));   // Common password
assert!(!is_password("unique_and_secure_passphrase")); // Not in common list
```

## üéØ Special Cases

The library handles various special cases:

- Code snippets are classified as gibberish
- URLs in text are preserved for analysis
- Technical terms and abbreviations are recognized
- Mixed-language content is supported
- ASCII art is detected as gibberish
- Common internet text patterns are recognized

## üßÆ Algorithm Deep Dive

The gibberish detection algorithm combines multiple scoring components into a weighted composite score. Here's a detailed look at each component:

### Composite Score Formula

The final classification uses a weighted sum:

$S = 0.4E + 0.25T + 0.15G_3 + 0.1G_4 + 0.1V$

Where:
- $E$ = English word ratio
- $T$ = Character transition probability
- $G_3$ = Trigram score
- $G_4$ = Quadgram score
- $V$ = Vowel-consonant ratio (binary: 1 if in range [0.3, 0.7], 0 otherwise)

### Length-Based Threshold Adjustment

The threshold is dynamically adjusted based on text length:

```rust
let threshold = match text_length {
    0..=20  => 0.7,  // Very short text needs higher threshold
    21..=50 => 0.8,  // Short text
    51..=100 => 0.9, // Medium text
    101..=200 => 1.0,// Standard threshold
    _ => 1.1,        // Long text can be more lenient
} * sensitivity_factor;
```

### Character Entropy

We calculate Shannon entropy to measure randomness:

$H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2(p_i)$

Where $p_i$ is the probability of character $i$ occurring in the text.

```rust
let entropy = char_frequencies.iter()
    .map(|p| -p * p.log2())
    .sum::<f64>();
```

### N-gram Analysis

Trigrams and quadgrams are scored using frequency analysis:

$G_n = \frac{\text{valid n-grams}}{\text{total n-grams}}$

```rust
let trigram_score = valid_trigrams.len() as f64 / total_trigrams.len() as f64;
let quadgram_score = valid_quadgrams.len() as f64 / total_quadgrams.len() as f64;
```

### Character Transition Probability

We analyze character pair frequencies against known English patterns:

$T = \frac{\text{valid transitions}}{\text{total transitions}}$

The transition matrix is pre-computed from a large English corpus and stored as a perfect hash table.

### Sensitivity Levels

The final threshold varies by sensitivity:
- Low: $0.35 \times \text{length\_factor}$
- Medium: $0.25 \times \text{length\_factor}$
- High: $0.15 \times \text{length\_factor}$

### Special Case Overrides

The algorithm includes fast-path decisions:

1. If English word ratio > 0.8: Not gibberish
2. If ‚â• 3 English words (Medium/High sensitivity): Not gibberish
3. If no English words AND transition score < 0.3 (Low/Medium): Gibberish

### Why These Weights?

- **Word Ratio (40%)**: Strong indicator of English text
- **Transitions (25%)**: Captures natural language patterns
- **Trigrams (15%)**: Common subword patterns
- **Quadgrams (10%)**: Longer patterns, but noisier
- **Vowel Ratio (10%)**: Basic language structure

This weighting balances accuracy with computational efficiency, prioritizing stronger indicators while still considering multiple aspects of language structure.
